#purpose:
this repository is a hodge podge of random relatively short scripts, that don't necessarily need to have their own dedicated repository.

#how to use:
most scripts can simply be downloaded and run in the terminal/in powershell, anything more complicated will eventually be migrated to its own repository

#potential future plans:
I may one day publish these on a website for the express purpose of running ads, it would likely be geared towards elementary school teachers
